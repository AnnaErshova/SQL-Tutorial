h2. An Introduction to Grouping and Summing Using SQLite (Just the Steps)

h3. Review: CREATE and INSERT statements

1. Create a new database called campaign_finance (SQLite manager will save the file as campaign_finance.sqlite).

2. Create a new table called "contributions":
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE "contributions" ("id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY  AUTOINCREMENT  NOT NULL, "committee_id" VARCHAR,
"entity_type" VARCHAR, "last_name" VARCHAR, "first_name" VARCHAR, "city" VARCHAR, "state" VARCHAR, "zip_code" VARCHAR,
"employer" VARCHAR, "occupation" VARCHAR, "amount" INTEGER)</code></pre>

3. Add a few rows of data:
<pre><code>
INSERT INTO contributions (committee_id, entity_type, last_name, first_name, city, state, zip_code, employer, occupation, amount) VALUES ('C00494740','IND','WINFREY','OPRAH','CHICAGO','IL','60607','HARPO INC.','CHAIRMAN/CEO',500);
INSERT INTO contributions (committee_id, entity_type, last_name, first_name, city, state, zip_code, employer, occupation, amount)  VALUES ('C00494740','IND','PRITZKER','PENNY S','CHICAGO','IL','60614','HYATT','EXEC',2500);
INSERT INTO contributions (committee_id, entity_type, last_name, first_name, city, state, zip_code, employer, occupation, amount) VALUES ('C00431171','IND','ADELSON','SHELDON','LAS VEGAS','NV','89109','VENETIAN HOTEL','OWNER','2500');
INSERT INTO contributions (committee_id, entity_type, last_name, first_name, city, state, zip_code, employer, occupation, amount) VALUES ('C00431171','IND','MARRIOTT','BILL MR. JR.','BETHESDA','MD','20817','MARRIOTT INTERNATINAL INC.','CHAIRMAN & C.E.O.','587');
</code></pre>

h3. Review: SELECT and WHERE

4. Write a query to select all fields from contributions greater than $500 and less than $1000.

h3. Using BETWEEN to find values in a range
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributions WHERE amount BETWEEN 500 AND 1000;</code></pre>
Note: equivalent is <pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributions WHERE amount >= 500 AND amount <= 1000;</code></pre>

h3. Using IN to choose from a list

1. Select all contributions from Alabama, Georgia or Florida:
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributions WHERE state IN ('AL', 'GA', 'FL');</code></pre>

2. Select all contributions from some state other than California, Oregon or Arizona:
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributions WHERE state NOT IN ('CA', 'OR', 'AZ');</code></pre>

h3. Wildcard matching with LIKE

3. Scroll through the Zip codes to see the issue:
<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT city, state, zip_code FROM contributions WHERE city = 'NEW YORK' AND state = 'NY' ORDER BY zip_code;</code></pre>
<pre><code>SELECT zip_code FROM contributions WHERE zip_code = '10017';</code></pre>

Use % to match any number of characters.
<pre><code>SELECT zip_code FROM contributions WHERE zip_code LIKE '10017%';</code></pre>

5. Find all contributions where the middle initial is included in the first_name field:
Use _ to match exactly one character.
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributions WHERE first_name LIKE '% _.'; </code></pre>

h3. Dealing with NULL values

Another data problem:
<pre><code>SELECT first_name, last_name FROM contributions WHERE state = 'NH';</pre></code>

6. How do we find any rows missing the last_name value?
NOTE: "=" won't work.
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributions WHERE last_name IS NULL;</code></pre>

7. How do we find any New Hampshire contribution by someone whose last name isn't "BAKER":

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributions WHERE state = 'NH';</code></pre>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributors WHERE state = 'VA' AND last_name <> 'BAKER';</code></pre>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributors WHERE state = 'VA' AND last_name <> 'BAKER' AND last_name IS NOT NULL;</code></pre>

h3. Manipulating text with string functions

8. Use SUBSTR() to get a substring
<pre><code>SELECT zip_code FROM contributions WHERE SUBSTR(zip_code, 1, 5) = '10017';</code></pre>
<pre><code>SELECT SUBSTR(zip_code, 1, 5) FROM contributions;</code></pre>

9. Use TRIM() to get rid of leading and trailing whitespace
   a. Change Oprah's row to introduce whitepace around the state name:
      <pre><code>UPDATE contributions SET state = ' IL ' WHERE last_name = 'Winfrey';</code></pre>
   b. Now check to see that you've created a new state:
      <pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT state FROM contributions;</pre></code>
   c. Use TRIM() to set things right:
      <pre><code>UPDATE contributions SET state = TRIM(state);</pre></code>

10. Use UPPER() or LOWER() to handle inconsistent capitalization
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributions WHERE state = 'AL' AND city = 'Birmingham';</code></pre>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributions WHERE state = 'AL';</code></pre>
<pre><code>SELECT * from contributions WHERE UPPER(city) = 'BIRMINGHAM';</code></pre>
NOTE: case sensitivity is system-dependent. In SQLite, LIKE is not case sensitive. In MySQL, "=" is not case sensitive.
It's safer to be explicit about case so your SQL is portable.

11. Use || to concatenate strings
<pre><code>SELECT city || ',' || state FROM contributions ORDER BY state, city;</code></pre>


h3. Aggregate Functions

12. Count the number of contributions from California:
<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(id) FROM contributions WHERE state = 'CA';</code></pre>

13. Find out how many zip codes there are in the table:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT zip_code)  FROM contributions;

14. Select the minimum and maximum contributions:
<pre><code>SELECT MAX(amount) FROM contributions;</code></pre>
<pre><code>SELECT MIN(amount) FROM contributions;</code></pre>

15. Add up the contributions from Georgia:
<pre><code>SELECT SUM(amount) FROM contributions WHERE state = 'GA';</code></pre>

16. Find the average contribution:
<pre><code>SELECT AVG(amount) FROM contributions;</code></pre>

17. Find the total amount of contributions per state:
<pre><code>SELECT state, SUM(amount) FROM contributions GROUP BY state;</code></pre>

18. Find the total amount of contributions per city and state:
<pre><code>SELECT city, state, SUM(amount) FROM contributions GROUP BY city, state;</code></pre>
Now order cities by their total contributions:
<pre><code>SELECT city, state, SUM(amount) FROM contributions GROUP BY city, state ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;</code></pre>
 

h3. Using Subqueries

19. A failed attempt to get all contributors who gave the maximum:
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributions WHERE amount = MAX(amount);</code></pre>

20. Doing it right with a subquery

What we want is:
<pre><code>SELECT MAX(amount) FROM contributions;</code></pre> -- The result is 5000
And then, using the result of that query:
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributions WHERE amount = 5000;</code></pre>

Combine them with a subquery:
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contributions WHERE amount = (SELECT MAX(amount) FROM contributions);</code></pre>

21. Use a subquery to total the amounts from the top 20 contributions
<pre><code>SELECT SUM(amount) FROM contributions WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM contributions ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 20);</code></pre>

h3. Grouping with Group By

23. Get total amount contributed by state:
<pre><code>SELECT state, SUM(amount) FROM contributions GROUP BY state;</code></pre>

24. Or by city (grouping by two columns):
<pre><code>SELECT city, state, SUM(amount) FROM contributions GROUP BY city, state;</code></pre>

25. And easily see which cities gave the most (using ORDER BY):
<pre><code>SELECT city, state, SUM(amount) FROM contributions GROUP BY city, state ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;</code></pre>

26. Be wary of any non-aggregate fields in the SELECT clause that aren't in the GROUP BY:
<pre><code>SELECT city, state, SUM(amount) FROM contributions GROUP BY state ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;</code></pre>

h3. Filtering by aggregate values using HAVING

27. A failed attempt to return totals for cities where at least $3,000 has been contributed:
<pre><code>SELECT city, state, SUM(amount) FROM contributions WHERE SUM(amount) >= 3000  GROUP BY city, state  ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;</code></pre>

28. And the way that works:
<pre><code>SELECT city, state, SUM(amount) FROM contributions GROUP BY city, state HAVING SUM(amount) >= 3000 ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;</code></pre>

29. What's the difference betwen WHERE and HAVING?
    a. A simple WHERE:
    <pre><code>SELECT city, state, amount FROM contributions WHERE amount >= 2300;</code></pre>
    b. Where with a GROUP BY:
    <pre><code>SELECT city, state, SUM(amount) FROM contributions WHERE amount >= 2300 GROUP BY city, state;</code></pre>
    c. Now limiting those cities by the total contributions:
    <pre><code>SELECT city, state, SUM(amount) FROM contributions WHERE amount >= 2300 GROUP BY city, state HAVING SUM(amount) > 4000;</code></pre>
